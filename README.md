# NumericalMethodsProjects

Set of simple projects for `Numerical Methods` course at Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology

`MD1` - Implementation of MACD trading indicator and making predictions based on given CSV for bitcoin rate.
Script displays plot showing values from CSV, macd and signal lines for visualization.

Based on incoming predictions script tries to invest having defined start amount of dollars owned.

`MD2` - Implementation of Matrix Factorization algorithms and showing their measured performance on visualization.
Implemented methods:
- LU
- Jacobi's
- Gaus-Seidl

`MD3` - Interpolation of few given altitude profiles in csv format using following methods:
- Lagrange's Interpolation Polynominal 
- Splines of third degree

Script shows visualialization comparing the interpolated results with the real ones.
